# Coin Flipper [Archived]

> **Note:** This project was officially archived in **January 2026**. This documentation is preserved for historical purposes; the bot is no longer actively maintained or hosted.

Coin Flipper **was** a fun and customizable Discord bot that **could** flip coins, start minigames, and **did** much more! From minigames and lottery tickets to jobs and registers, there **were** plenty of fun commands that **livened** up servers.

#### Flipping Coins
As the name **implied**, coin flipping **was** the main purpose of the bot. Not only **was** there classic flipping, but users **could** also use addons to make the experience more engaging. For example, the extra addon **included** over 100 unique responses to flipping a coin.

#### Awesome Currency
Coin Flipper **included** a currency called **Cents**. With Cents, users **could** buy items, addons, and more. There **were** plenty of ways to earn them, such as flipping coins, purchasing lottery tickets, working virtual jobs, and more.

#### Unique Features
There **were** several unique features that Coin Flipper **offered** which **were** difficult to find anywhere else:
- **Special items** that performed unique actions, such as opening a register or granting access to a monthly command.
- A **unique trash can** for the server where users **could** throw items in and take items out.
- **7 collectible badges** that, once earned, **displayed** on a user's profile for all to see.

#### Lots of Fun
Coin Flipper **featured** a variety of interactive commands that **kept** servers active and made them a cooler place to hang out. It **served** as a central hub for many communities during its time online.


## Support

#### General Support
While the bot **was** active, general support **was** provided through the [Discord Support Server](https://coinflipper.liamskinner.co.uk/support). Developers and community members **were** available to answer concerns and help users navigate the bot's features.

#### Reporting Issues
During its lifecycle, two separate ways **were** supported to report issues and bugs:

1. The **/report** command within the support server, which **alerted** the developers immediately.
2. Opening an **issue** on the GitHub repository, where users **could** fill out relevant fields to submit a report.
